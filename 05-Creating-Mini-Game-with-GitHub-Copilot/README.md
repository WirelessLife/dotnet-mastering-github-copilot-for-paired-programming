# Creating a Mini Game with GitHub Copilot

In this module, we‚Äôll explore how to use GitHub Copilot to build a classic rock, paper, scissors minigame. This hands-on project is designed to sharpen your programming skills and enhance your ability to develop console applications in C#. Best of all, we‚Äôll use GitHub Codespaces, so there‚Äôs no need to worry about setting up a development environment. With GitHub Copilot as your AI pair programmer, you can focus on creating your application while effortlessly collaborating with your intelligent coding assistant. Lets begin.

You have already learned a bit about GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Copilot and how they work. In this challenge exercise, your goal is to develop a minigame in C# using GitHub Copilot. 

#### Testing your GitHub Codespace

> **Note:** You may need to install the C# Dev Kit Extension in Visual Studio Code if it isn't currently installed.

1. Create a new .NET project by using the `.NET: New Project...` command and selecting `Console App`. 
1. Select a folder and name the project **MiniGame**.
1. Open `Program.cs`

1. Type the following comment:

   ```csharp
   // write 'hello world' to the console
   ```
      
1. GitHub Copilot should complete the code for you and provide the following result:

   ```csharp
   // write 'hello world' to the console
   Console.WriteLine("hello world");
   ```

1. Run the application with the *dotnet run* command in the terminal and check if the result is similar to the following console message:

   ```bash
   hello world
   ```
   
### Creating the game logic

Now that you've verified that Codespaces working with GitHub Copilot, your next step is to develop the logic of the C# minigame with the help of GitHub Copilot based on the following specifications:

The winner of the game is determined by three simple rules:

- **Rock** beats scissors.
- **Scissors** beat paper.
- **Paper** beats rock.

#### Game interaction considerations

The computer will be your opponent and can randomly choose one of the elements (**rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**). Your game interaction will be through the console (Terminal).

- The player can choose one of the three options rock, paper, or scissors and should be warned if they enter an invalid option.
- At each round, the player must enter one of the options in the list and be informed if they won, lost, or tied with the opponent.
- By the end of each round, the player can choose whether to play again.
- Display the player's score at the end of the game.
- The minigame must handle user inputs, putting them in lowercase and informing the user if the option is invalid.

In your GitHub Codespaces, follow the given instructions to set up prompts that GitHub Copilot can understand and use to help you build the minigame. Keep in mind that GitHub Copilot relies on comments to grasp the context and give you helpful suggestions while you're working on your project.

#### Verify your work

1. Run the minigame on the console with the *dotnet run* command.
2. At the prompt, type one of the game options: *rock*, *paper*, or *scissors*.
3. The minigame should inform the player whether the player won, lost, or tied with the opponent.
4. Choose to continue playing.
5. At the prompt, type *screen*.
6. The minigame should inform the player if the option entered by the player is invalid.
7. Repeat steps 2 and 4 to play a few rounds and choose not to continue playing.
8. Check if the minigame is terminated and if it displays your score, informing you of the number of wins and rounds.

Congratulations on completing this challenge exercise! You've created a C# console minigame using GitHub Copilot.
